        "# RBM Deep Dive with Tensorflow \n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we provide a complete walkthough of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) algorithm with applications to recommender systems. In particular, we use as a case study the [movielens dataset](https://movielens.org), comprising the ranking of movies (from 1 to 5) given by viewers. A quickstart version of this notebook can be found here.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Overview \n",
        "\n",
        "The RBM is a generative neural network model used to perform unsupervised learning. The main task of an RBM is to learn the joint probability distribution $P(v,h)$, where $v$ are the visible units and $h$ the hidden ones. The hidden units represent latent variables while the visible units are clamped on the input data. Once the joint distribution is learnt, new examples are generated by sampling from it.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation presented here is based on the article by Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Andriy Mnih and Geoffrey Hinton [Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/rbmcf.pdf) with the exception that here we use multinomial units instead of one-hot encoded. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of RBM: \n",
        "\n",
        "The model generates ratings for a user/movie pair using a collaborative filtering based approach. While matrix factorization methods learn how to reproduce an instance of the user/item affinity matrix, the RBM learns its underlying probability distribution. This has several advantages: \n",
        "\n",
        "- Generalizability : the model generalize well to new examples as long as they do not differ much in probability\n",
        "- Stability in time: if the recommendation task is time-stationary, the model does not need to be trained often to accomodate new ratings/users. \n",
        "- Scales well with the size of the dataset and the sparsity of the user/affinity matrix. \n",
        "- The tensorflow implementation presented here allows fast, scalable  training on GPU \n",

        "The Movielens dataset comes in different sizes, denoting the number of available ratings. The number of users and rated movies also changes across the different dataset. The data are imported in a pandas dataframe including the **user ID**, the **item ID**, the **ratings** and a **timestamp** denoting when a particular user rated a particular item. Although this last feature could be explicitely included, it will not be considered here. The underlying assumption of this choice is that user's tastes are weakly time dependent, i.e. a user's taste typically chage on time scales (usually years) much longer than the typical recommendation time scale (e.g. hours/days). As a consequence, the joint probability distribution we want to learn can be safely considered as time dependent. Nevertheless, timestamps could be used as *contextual variables*, e.g. recommend a certain movie during the weekend and another during weekdays.  \n",
