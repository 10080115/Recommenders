    "# RBM Deep Dive with Tensorflow \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we provide a complete walkthough of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) algorithm with applications to recommender systems. In particular, we use as a case study the [movielens dataset](https://movielens.org), comprising the ranking of movies (from 1 to 5) given by viewers. A quickstart version of this notebook can be found [here](notebooks/00_quick_start/rbm_movielens.ipynb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "The RBM is a generative neural network model used to perform unsupervised learning. The main task of an RBM is to learn the joint probability distribution $P(v,h)$, where $v$ are the visible units and $h$ the hidden ones. The hidden units represent latent variables while the visible units are clamped on the input data. Once the joint distribution is learnt, new examples are generated by sampling from it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation presented here is based on the article by Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Andriy Mnih and Geoffrey Hinton [Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/rbmcf.pdf) with the exception that here we use multinomial units instead of one-hot encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of RBM: \n",
    "\n",
    "The model generates ratings for a user/movie pair using a collaborative filtering based approach. While matrix factorization methods learn how to reproduce an instance of the user/item affinity matrix, the RBM learns its underlying probability distribution. This has several advantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Generalizability : the model generalize well to new examples as long as they do not differ much in probability\n",
    "- Stability in time: if the recommendation task is time-stationary, the model does not need to be trained often to accomodate new ratings/users. \n",
    "- Scales well with the size of the dataset and the sparsity of the user/affinity matrix. \n",
    "- The tensorflow implementation presented here allows fast, scalable  training on GPU \n",

    "## 1.1 Overview and main differences with other recommender algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an undirected graphical model with origin in the statistical mechanics (or physics) of magnetic systems. Statistical mechanics (SM) provides a probabilistic description of complex systems made of a huge number of constituents (typically $\\sim 10^{23}$); instead of looking at a particular instance of the system, the aim of SM is to describe their **typical** behaviour. This approach has been succesfull for the description of gases, liquids, complex materials (e.g. semiconductors) and even the famous [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Being designed to handle and organize a large amount of data, SM finds ideal applications in modern learnign algorithms. In the context of **recommender systems**, the idea is to learn typical user behaviour instead of particular instances. To understand this better, consider the most general setup of a recmmendation problem: there are $m$ users rating $n$ items according to some scale (e.g. 1 to 5). In a typical scenario of online shopping, streaming services or decision processes, the user only rates a subset $l \\ll m$ of the products. If we now create a matrix representation of this problem, we obtain the user/item affinity matrix $X$. In a more readable table form, $X$ will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|     |$i_1$  |$i_2$  |$i_3$  |  ... |$i_m$  | \n",
    "|-----|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|\n",
    "|$u_1$|5      |0      |2      |0 ... |1      |\n",
    "|$u_2$|0      |0      |3      |4 ... |0      |\n",
    "|...  |...    |...    |...    |...   |...    |\n",
    "|$u_m$|3      |3      |0      |5...  |2      |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where zeroes denote unrated items. In a nutshell, the recommender task is to \"fill in\" the missing ratings (later we will see that in practice this is not the only criteria to recommend a product). The classical approach to this problem is called matrix factorization: the basic idea is to decompose $X$ into a user ($P$) and item ($Q$) matrix, such that $X = Q^T P$. The dimensions of the two matrices are $dim(Q) = (f, n)$ and $dim(P)= (f,m)$ where $f \\le m,n$ is the number of latent factors, e.g. the genre of a movie, the type of food etc... and it is an hyperparameter of the model, for more details see the [ALS notebook](notebooks/02_modeling/als_deep_dive.ipynb). By learning $Q$ and $P$ we try to reproduce a particular instance of $X$ (provided by the available data) and use this information to fill up the missing matrix elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RBM approach is to look at $X$ as a particular realization (sample) of a more general process; instead of learning a specific $X$, we try to learn the matrix distrbution from which $X$ has been sampled form. Efectively, we learn the typical distirbution of *tastes* (i.e. latent factors) and use this information to *generate* new ratings. For this reaoson, this class of neural network models is also called **generative**. Consider the following example: imagine you are given the  income distribution per age window of a particular country (this is easy to find from goverments data), then we could fix the age window and *generate* virtual citizens with various incomes by sampling from this distibution.

For this reason, this class of models is also known as *energy based* in computer science. In physics, $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature of the system in units of Boltzmann's constant, but here we will effectively rescale inside $H$, so that this is now a pure number. $H$ describes the behaviour of two sets of stochastic vectors, typically called $v_i$ (visibles) and $h_j$ (hidden). The former constitutes both the input *and* the ouput of the algo (this will be clear later), while the hidden units are the latent factors we want to learn. This structure results in the following Neural Network topology\n",

    "The input of the movielens databse consists of ratings from 1 to 5; we shall thus consider a discrete configuration space of $m$ visible variables, each taking values in a finite set $\\chi_v = \\{ 1, 2, 3,4,5 \\}$. A global configuration of the system is determined by $\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_m) \\in \\chi_v^m$ and we reserve $0$ for an unrated movie. We also need to specify the hidden units, that we take as random binary variables $\\chi_h = \\{0,1 \\}$ denoting if the particular unit is active or not and $\\mathbf{h} = (h_1, h_2, ...,h_n) \\in \\chi_h^n$. As we said before, the hidden units may describe attributes such as the genre of a movie; so given for example an sci-fi/horror movie, only the hidden units describing such attribute should be active. The minimal model for such a system is defined by the following Hamiltonian: \n",

    "\n",
    "The first term is an \"interaction term\", capturing the correlations between the visible and hidden units, while the other two terms are \"potential terms\", taking into account the bias of the units. The correlation matrix $w_{ij}$ and the two biases $a_i$ and $b_i$ are learning parameters to be fixed by the minimization of a properly defined cost function. Remember that this is an unsupervised problem, i.e. there is no real output and therefore we cannot directly minimize the error function between the prediction and the labeled data. As in every SM problem, the right quantity to minimize is the Free energy (remember that $\\beta =1$ and there is a minus sign difference for convention)\n",

    "In the langiage of probaility theory, the above quantity is the cumulant generating function. One way of evaluating the free energy is to use a [Markov-chain Montecarlo sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Computer_graphics) algorithm such as the Metropolis-Hasting; here we will use instead an approximate method called Contrastive divergence, based on [Gibbs sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling) (see below). The latter algorithm has the advantage of being faster than the Montecarlo ones. Once the candidate $F$ has been found, we fix the learning parameters by extremizing $F$. Let us see how this works in practive in the next section. "

In the former case, we cut off a certain proportion of training examples from the dataset (e.g. images), here corresponding to users (or items), ending up with two matrices (train and test) having different row dimensions. To make the RBM works corerctly, we need to mantain the same matrix size for the train and test set, but the two will contain different amounts of ratings. To see this in practice, let us describe what the `rbm_splitters` class does in details: \n",

The main difference is in the degree of sparsness of the user/item affinity matrix; this is an important factor as it states the ratio between datapoints and unrated movies to infere. Note that the split function returns the total (or per dataset) sparsness, not the user-wise one. \n",

    "During training, we evauate the Root mean squared error to have an idea of how the learning is proceeding. We would generally like to see this quantity decreasing as a function of the learning epochs. The two final scores are the train/test mean average accuracies across the all set together with their difference. Remeber that for a model to generate well the difference between train and test metrics should not be too big. In order to visualize these online metrics, choose `with_metrics =True` in the `RBM()` model function. "
